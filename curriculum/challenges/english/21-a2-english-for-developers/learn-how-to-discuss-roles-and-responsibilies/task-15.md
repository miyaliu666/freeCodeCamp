# --description--

The word `everyone` is used to refer to all people in a group. It's important to note that even though `everyone` sounds like it's talking about many people, you use it with a singular verb, as if it's just one person. This is similar to other words starting with `every` like `everything` and `everybody`. For example, you say `Everyone is happy` or `Everybody goes to the party`.
