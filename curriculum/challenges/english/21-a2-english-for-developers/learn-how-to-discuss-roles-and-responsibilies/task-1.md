AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: Hey, have you met Anna yet?
-->

# --description--

The phrase `have you met` uses the present perfect tense, which is formed with `have` or `has` plus the past participle of a verb. In this case, `met` is the past participle of `meet`. Use `have` with the pronouns `I`, `you`, `we`, and `they`, and use `has` with `he`, `she`, and `it`. This tense is used to talk about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past and have relevance to the present. The word `yet` often accompanies questions in the present perfect tense to inquire if something has happened up to now.
