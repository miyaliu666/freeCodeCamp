# --description--

This dialogue uses a contraction common in English. Contractions like `you've` (`you have`), `she's` (`she has`), or `they've` (`they have`) in the present perfect tense make speech sound more natural and are often used in informal conversations. Adding `just` in this tense indicates an action that happened very recently, emphasizing its closeness to the present moment.
