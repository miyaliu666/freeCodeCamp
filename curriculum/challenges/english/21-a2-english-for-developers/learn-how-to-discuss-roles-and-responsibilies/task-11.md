AUDIO REFERENCE:

# --description--

The phrase `She's been working` uses the present perfect continuous tense. This tense is formed with `have/has been` plus the `-ing` form of a verb, like `working`. It describes actions that started in the past and are still ongoing, or have recently stopped but have an effect on the present. For example, `He's been teaching English for five years` implies continuous teaching up to now.
